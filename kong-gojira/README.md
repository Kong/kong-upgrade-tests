                      Gojira (Godzilla)

Usage: gojira action [options...]

Options:
  -t,  --tag            git tag to mount kong on (default: master)
  -p,  --prefix         prefix to use for namespacing
  -k,  --kong           PATH for a kong folder, will ignore tag
  -n,  --network        use network with provided name
  -pp, --port           expose a port for a kong container
  --repo                use another kong repo
  --image               image to use for kong
  --volume              add a volume to kong container
  --cassandra           use cassandra
  --alone               do not spin up any db
  --host                specify hostname for kong container
  -v,  --verbose        echo every command that gets executed
  -h,  --help           display this help

Commands:
  up            start a kong. if no -k path is specified, it will download
                kong-ee on $GOJIRA_KONGS folder and checkouts the -t tag.
                also fires up a postgres database .with it. for free.

  down          bring down the docker-compose thingie running in -t tag.
                remove it, nuke it from space. something went wrong, and you
                want a clear start or a less buggy tool to use.

  build         build a docker image with the specified VERSIONS

  run           run a command on a running container

  shell         get a shell on a running container

  cd            cd into a kong-ee prefix repo

  image         show current gojira image

  images        list gojira images

  ps            list running prefixes

  ls            list stored prefixes in $GOJIRA_KONGS

  snapshot      make a snapshot of a running gojira

  compose       alias for docker-compose, try: gojira compose help

  roar          make gojira go all gawo wowo

  logs          follow container logs

```

# gojira

gojira comes from far away to put an end to `vagrant up`, `vagrant destroy` and
`vagrant wait ten hours`.

Spin up as many kong-ee instances as you want. On different commits at the same
time. With different openssl, openresty and luarocks versions. Run a shell
inside of the containers, make kong roar. Make kong fail, cd into the repo, fix
it. Make kong start again. Commit it. Push it, ship it!

In all seriousness, use this tool only for development, for anything serious
use [kong-build-tools].
